In this project I created a webpage that initially makes a grid of 16x16 div elements that when moused over will get assigned a random color with a starting opacity of 0.1. When a div is moused over again, the opacity will increase by 0.1 and will stop when the opacity value is equal to 1. There is also a button that can be clicked, that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive), after entering this number a new grid of divs will be cretaed that will have X by X div elements where X is the number the user input.
